# Lesson 08 — AI Implementation

[Course home](../README.md) · [← Previous lesson](../lessons/07-agent-orchestration.md) · Lesson 08 of 12

## Why this lesson matters

Implementation is a controlled engineering loop, not a prompt followed by a code dump. The agent must understand the system, establish baseline, plan, implement, verify and report.

## Learning outcomes

- Explain the role of this stage in the end-to-end AI-native SDLC.
- Identify inputs, outputs, decision owners and exit criteria.
- Apply the principles to the Subscription Management case study.
- Recognize when an agent must stop, request clarification or provide evidence.

## Core concepts

Use Understand → Baseline → Plan → Implement → Verify → Report. Apply spec-driven implementation and TDD: tests derive from approved acceptance criteria; demonstrate failing behavior before the change where practical. Brownfield strategies include minimal patch, vertical slice, characterization tests, feature flag/strangler and contract-first. Never weaken tests to get green.

## How to apply it

The implementation agent works only on an approved work package. It must inspect existing code and tests, avoid unrelated edits, preserve business invariants, run relevant checks and provide exact evidence.

## Practical exercise

Prepare an implementation report that maps changed behavior to requirements and lists commands, outcomes, deviations and unresolved risks. Mark unexecuted checks honestly.

## Knowledge check — 10 questions

1. What best describes the purpose of this stage?
   - A. Create a traceable and controlled part of the delivery lifecycle
   - B. Generate code without context

   - B. The coding agent
   - C. The test runner
   - D. The cheapest model

10. What should the practical output demonstrate?
   - A. Only tool usage
   - B. A completed artifact with reviewable evidence
   - C. A production change without approval
   - D. Unrestricted autonomy

<summary><strong>Answer key and explanations</strong></summary>

1. **A** — This stage exists to produce a controlled, traceable delivery outcome.
2. **B** — Approved artifacts are the source of truth.
3. **C** — Critical uncertainty must be escalated, not concealed.
4. **D** — Evidence must demonstrate the expected behavior.
5. **A** — Autonomy is safe only within enforced boundaries.
6. **B** — Handoffs need enough context to continue safely.
7. **C** — Mandatory controls cannot be bypassed.
8. **D** — Metrics require sound definitions and interpretation.
9. **A** — Agents may advise, but accountable owners decide.
10. **B** — The course emphasizes verifiable artifacts, not tool demonstrations.
