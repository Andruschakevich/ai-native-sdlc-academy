# Lesson 10 — Release & Operations

[Course home](../README.md) · [← Previous lesson](../lessons/09-quality-engineering.md) · Lesson 10 of 12

## Why this lesson matters

Deployment is not completion. The workflow must observe technical health and business invariants and recover safely. Green infrastructure metrics are insufficient if payment-to-entitlement consistency is broken.

## Learning outcomes

- Explain the role of this stage in the end-to-end AI-native SDLC.
- Identify inputs, outputs, decision owners and exit criteria.
- Apply the principles to the Subscription Management case study.
- Recognize when an agent must stop, request clarification or provide evidence.

## Core concepts

Release readiness requires verified evidence, quality/security gates, migration plan, feature flags, monitoring, alerts, SLOs, rollback/roll-forward and named owners. Use staged canary rollout and observation windows. Distinguish rollback, roll-forward, reconciliation and compensation. Application rollback cannot undo an external payment.

## How to apply it

Release Agent checks readiness and controls permitted rollout. Observability Agent analyzes signals. Incident Agent builds timelines and hypotheses. Recovery Agent proposes safe recovery. Stop rollout automatically on pre-approved critical thresholds; financial compensation and destructive actions require human approval.

## Practical exercise

Tabletop: after a 5% canary, infrastructure metrics are green but some paid upgrades lack entitlements. Decide whether to promote, halt or reconcile. Define evidence needed before resuming.

<summary><strong>Answer key and explanations</strong></summary>

1. **A** — This stage exists to produce a controlled, traceable delivery outcome.
2. **B** — Approved artifacts are the source of truth.
3. **C** — Critical uncertainty must be escalated, not concealed.
4. **D** — Evidence must demonstrate the expected behavior.
5. **A** — Autonomy is safe only within enforced boundaries.
6. **B** — Handoffs need enough context to continue safely.
7. **C** — Mandatory controls cannot be bypassed.
8. **D** — Metrics require sound definitions and interpretation.
9. **A** — Agents may advise, but accountable owners decide.
10. **B** — The course emphasizes verifiable artifacts, not tool demonstrations.
